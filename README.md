## Tracker:
Phase 1: Navigation:
I have successfully completed building the navigation for my portfolio, creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface. Through thoughtful organization and design, users can easily navigate through my work, gaining insights into my abilities and experience in IT and computer science. This project highlights my attention to detail and commitment to delivering a seamless user experience.

### What I have learned in this part:
The process was challenging, particularly when it came to creating the open and close functionality for the dropdown menu. Through diligent research on Google and utilizing tutorials on YouTube, I was able to overcome this obstacle and successfully achieve my goal.
